## Off-boarding
The responsibility that the off-boarding should be done is the supervisor. 
Start by giving a notification a 2 months prior to the contract ending. 

The off-boarding  procedure consists of cleaning and organizing data. The goal of the off-boarding is to sort the data in finished projects (archive), ongoing project (transferred to other user or lab-coordinator) and killed projects that can be deleted. For finished project that data should be separated into sensitive and non-sensitive data. 

Transfer rights on files and folders supervisor/lab-coordinator. 

**What happens when you leave now from the HUNT cloud side?** The user is  inactivated after 6 months of inactivity. Delete the user 3 months after leaving the group by default unless extended. This is the supervisors responsibility.
